.Nd Automatic Packet Reporting System daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DG
.Op Fl g Ar sensor
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Fl p Ar period
.Op Fl l Ar latitude
.Op Fl L Ar longitude
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sends
.Em APRS
position reports using either GPS or user-supplied position information.
.Pp
.Nm
is usually started at boot time, and can be enabled by
setting the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl aprsd_flags=\&"\&"
.Pp
See
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
for more information on the boot process
and enabling daemons.
.Pp
.Nm
is configured using the
.Xr aprsd.conf 5
configuration file.
This defines the beacons to be sent periodically, and filter rules for
digipeater functionality.
The callsign found in
.Xr mycallsign 5
will be used as the originating address for position beacons.
The SSID is hardcoded as -6 for now.
.Pp
APRS uses
.Em AX.25
as a link layer, which restricts callsign length to at most 6 characters.
If your callsign is longer than 6 characters then
.Nm
will refuse to start.
.Pp
The
.Xr nmea 4
driver can be used to provide a live GPS position.
Other drivers that update the sensors framework may also work.
.Pp
If the sensor cannot be found, or the sensor does not have a valid latitude or
longitude, but a fixed latitude and longitude were provided, then the fixed
position will be used.
If no fixed position was provided, beacons are disabled until the sensor
provides a valid position again.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Do not daemonize.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Interface name to broadcast position reports (default: axkiss0).

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in HamBSD XXX.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
daemon was written for the HamBSD project by
.An Iain R. Learmonth Aq Mt irl@fsfe.org
for the public domain.
.Sh CAVEATS
It is not currently possible to broadcast position reports on multiple
interfaces with a single instance.
It is however possible to manually start multiple instances.
